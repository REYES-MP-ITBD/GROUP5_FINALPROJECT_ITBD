		<h2>Discussion:</h2> 
		<p>
		Universal Studios Japan, located in Osaka, is one of six Universal Studios theme parks,
		owned and operated by USJ LLC, which is wholly owned by NBCUniversal. The park is similar
		to the Universal Orlando Resort since it also contains selected attractions from Universal 
		Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood.
		<br>
		The park opened on 31 March 2001. Over 11 million guests visited the park in its opening year,
		 making it the world's fastest amusement park to have achieved the 10 million milestone at the time. 
		 Since then, Universal Studios Japan has had approximately 8 million visitors every year. Most visitors are 
		 Japanese tourists and tourists from other Asian countries such as South Korea and China. It is also very popular 
		 among Western tourists and expatriates. In 2005, Goldman Sachs became the largest shareholder in Universal Studios Japan.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>How to get there:</h2>
		You can easily reach Universal Studios using your Japan Rail Pass. While in Osaka, from Osaka Station City, take the Osaka loop line,
		also known as Osaka Kanjo line, to Nishikujo Station, then, take the Sakurajima line (also known as Yumesaki line) to Universal-City Station.

		Tempozan Giant Ferris Wheel <br>
		Dotombori District<br><br>
