	<blockquote><h2>Childhood Years</h2></blockquote>
	
	<div>
		<blockquote><p>
		My life began when I was at the age of 4.<sup>1</sup> I do have a lot of memories that I will never forget.<sup>2</sup>  
		I was this jolly, energetic, and optimistic kid who loves to wrap her arms around anyone, especially 
		to my dad.<sup>3</sup> I was a friendly kid who loves to be friends with anyone.<sup>4</sup> I used to play a lot with my 
		brother and that means I do love to play boys' games.<sup>5</sup> I wasn't a fan of girly things since I was a 
		kid but I do have a lot of girlfriends at that time.<sup>6</sup> Running and hiding from someone is my thing.<sup>7</sup> 
		I was really adventurous and willing to try new things even though it scares me.<sup>8</sup> Just like other kids, 
		I do have weaknesses that I don't have any idea how to cope with during those times.<sup>10</sup> My biggest fear 
		was being alone.<sup>11</sup> Not literally, but having no one by my side during my darkest days.<sup>12</sup> At the age of 7, 
		I've experienced one of the biggest challenges in my life.<sup>13</sup> My parents were separating and I had no idea 
		of their reasons.<sup>14</sup> I was having my siesta at my grandmother's room when I heard two people shouting.<sup>15</sup> 
		They were fighting over me regarding where am I gonna stay, if it's with my daddy or my mommy.<sup>16</sup> They 
		even pulled me in different directions and I ended up being with my mom.<sup>17</sup> I will never forget this 
		memory because I witnessed this kind of my parents' argument.<sup>18</sup> When I was 10, my parents came up with 
		the idea of staying with my dad during weekends and weekdays with my mom.<sup>19</sup> That only happened one summer 
		because they've decided to let us stay with my dad for us to go easier in school.<sup>20</sup> After those confusing
		setups, I can't help but not to question my self.<sup>21</sup> Questions were running in my head if my brother and I
		were not enough for them to stay together.<sup>22</sup> I know they have their reasons but still, it did hurt a lot.<sup>23</sup> 
		Just then I realized that there's nothing I can do but to accept everything and move on.<sup>24</sup> <strong><em>I kept reminding 
		myself that I will not let this pain consume me, make me do stupid things, and waste my life.</em></strong><sup>25</sup> <strong><em>
		I even pursue harder to prove anyone belittling me that even though I came from a broken family, that won't 
		stop me from achieving my goals and make my parents proud.</em></strong><sup>26</sup>

	<blockquote><h2>Teenage Years</h2></blockquote>
	
	<div>
		<blockquote><p>
		Years past and adjustments were made, I reached the most exciting stage of my life; 
		being a teenager.<sup>1</sup> My badminton career started in this stage though my interest in 
		playing badminton started when I was 6 years old.<sup>2</sup> My dad and I used to play badminton 
		a lot but then he was assigned to Davao and that was a huge adjustment for me.<sup>3</sup> I was 
		in Grade 7 having huge adjustments with the environment and the curriculum of that 
		school while he was far from me.<sup>4</sup> At that time, it was hard for me to adjust because 
		I'm not the same friendly little girl as I used to be.<sup>5</sup> I've undergone a major change
		in my attitude.<sup>6</sup> I became the total opposite of my self when I was young.<sup>7</sup> As I adapt
		to the environment, I met some friends who became my companion and made me tough
		enough during those days.<sup>8</sup> Alongside, I pursued my father's dream to continue his 
		legacy in playing sports.<sup>9</sup> Since my brother doesn't play any sport, I was the one who
		made that dream come true for my dad.<sup>10</sup> I became a student-athlete since I was in 
		Grade 7 though I wasn't competing at that time.<sup>11</sup> I started competing when I was 
		in Grade 8.<sup>12</sup> I was very nervous but then my dad was always there for me to support
		and guide me during my games.<sup>13</sup> He was my personal coach and my number one supporter.<sup>14</sup>
		He motivated me to train harder and achieve my goals in my badminton career.<sup>15</sup> 
		I was able to compete in the regionals and didn't win a medal but gave me a 
		lot of lessons and pushed me harder to train more.<sup>16</sup> I competed in regionals 
		for 3 years straight but then I got a back injury.<sup>17</sup> That injury made me question 
		myself and decided not to pursue my dream to compete in UAAP and just settle in 
		Cavite because I struggled in that back injury when I was training.<sup>18</sup> <strong><em>I planned my
		life to give up my badminton career in college and just focus on my studies.</em></strong><sup>19</sup> 
		Before my graduation, someone messaged me to try out at the University of the East.<sup>20</sup>
		At first, <strong><em>I was hesitating but then my dad and I had a deep conversation.</em></strong><sup>21</sup> 
		<strong><em>That made me realized that there's nothing I would lose so I did try out.</em></strong><sup>22</sup> 
		That decision made all of my plans changed.<sup>23</sup>

	<blockquote><h2><em>College Years</em></h2></blockquote>
	
	<div>
		<blockquote><p>
		I always fear the thought of being a college student.<sup>1</sup> It was the stage 
		where we were going to make our path to the career we want to pursue.<sup>2</sup> 
		I was really confused about which course should I take but one thing for
		sure is that I will never continue my sports career.<sup>3</sup> The only thing that
		changed my mind was the time when I went to the try-out at the University
		of the East.<sup>4</sup> Before entering any university, I went to some try-outs like 
		in National University in Manila and De La Salle University in Cavite.<sup>5</sup> I
		was thinking of trying at Adamson University but I was too late to their 
		scheduled try-outs.<sup>6</sup> I talked to my dad so I can decide which university
		should I choose and ended up entering UE.<sup>7</sup> I had the best hardworking and 
		supportive teammates.<sup>8</sup> We had a great time before the semester started.<sup>9</sup> We 
		really had fun at our training.<sup>10</sup> As the semester started, my teammates were
		the ones who pushed and motivated me to go out of my comfort zone.<sup>11</sup> They
		reminded me always that I shouldn't be shy to meet new people.<sup>12</sup> My skills 
		in determining who are the people I should trust were tested.<sup>13</sup> Manila is one 
		of the dangerous place but it will teach you a lot of important life lessons.<sup>14</sup>
		placesMonths passed, the UAAP season started and we had to double our hard 
		work in training.<sup>15</sup> We need to train more because we had this goal to at least 
		never let our school rank last.<sup>16</sup> I was really nervous at that time because 
		of my injury, the pressure, and the thought of playing in front of so many 
		people.<sup>17</sup> It was a hard time for me because even though I competed in a lot 
		of schools when I was in high school it still feels different to play in a 
		high-level competition like UAAP.<sup>18</sup> My family, high school best friends, 
		and some of my college friends supported me during my games.<sup>19</sup> I received a 
		lot of messages from them, handwritten letters to boost my confidence, and
		one of them watched.<sup>20</sup> Those little things really made me confident enough 
		to try my very best in all my games.<sup>21</sup> We weren't able to achieve our goal 
		because most of us were just rookies but we had a lot of realizations and 
		lessons.<sup>22</sup> I was touched when my dad told me that he was so proud of me during 
		my games.<sup>23</sup> <strong><em>The thought of me playing in UAAP made him really happy.</em></strong><sup>24</sup> I became 
		more motivated to improve my skills after hearing those stuff.<sup>25</sup> <strong><em>I don't want 
		to waste all the time and effort my dad had given me.</em></strong><sup>26</sup> <strong><em>All the personal training 
		we had, traveled far to join tournaments, and all the deep talks we had to 
		boost my morale in playing.</em></strong><sup>27</sup> <strong><em>All my achievements are dedicated to my parents 
		especially to my dad who sacrificed a lot for me to reach where I am right now.</em></strong><sup>28</sup>
