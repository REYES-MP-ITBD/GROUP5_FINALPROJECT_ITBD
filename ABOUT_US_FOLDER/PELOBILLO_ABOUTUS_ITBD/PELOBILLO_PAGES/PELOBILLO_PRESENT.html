							Hello, I'm Lance Diether M. Pelobillo.<sup>1</sup> I'm 19 years old<sup>2</sup>
							I was born at Manila and I'm living with my parents here at <i>Santa Rosa
							Laguna.</i><sup>3</sup> I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year college student and currently taking the course
							<i>Information Technology</i> here at the University of the East - Manila. <sup>4</sup>I started studying here
							when I was at Senior High School,<sup>5</sup> I remember that when I was grade 12 I'm a club president.<sup>6</sup>
							My club name was <i>UE ArtEast</i><sup>7</sup> the club that I'm handling gained a lot of attention because of our
							outstanding performances we did.<sup>8</sup> One of the projects that our club made is,<sup>9</sup> when I was the
							one who's making our university pep squad props.<sup>10</sup>

					<p>
						We manage to do it on time even though we're lacking
						of time because doing those stuffs was really hard and it put us some pressure,<sup>11</sup> becuase if we didn't manage
						to pull it off on time our pep squad won't have something to use at the competition.<sup>12</sup> I am also the
						representative when UE have this competion where all the departments will design for christmas decoration and put
						it at our Tan Yan Kee garden.<sup>13</sup> I'm representing the Basic Education and our competitorsthat time was College
						of Education, College of Computer Science System, and more.<sup>14</sup> But still, we manage to pull it off and made it
						to the top.<sup>15</sup> I also love to play Badminton.<sup>16</sup> I am actually an athlete here at the university.
						<sup>17</sup> I've played and compete at one of the biggest sports associoation here in the Philippines (UAAP).<sup>18</sup>
						My first apperance the UAAP was on 2020 UAAP Season 82. <sup>19</sup>I also compete Internationally. <sup>20</sup> One of
						my best experience when I compete outside the country was held at <i>Singapore</i> <sup>21</sup> and I actually won the
						Tournament and became a Champion.<sup>22</sup>
