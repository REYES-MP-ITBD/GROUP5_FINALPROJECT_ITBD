	<img src="media/Affiliate Marketing.png" class="left">
	<blockquote><p>Affiliate marketing is an online sales tactic that lets a product owner increase sales by allowing others targeting the same audience—“affiliates”—to earn a commission by recommending the product to others. At the same time, it makes it possible for affiliates to earn money on product sales without creating products of their own.
	</p></blockquote>
	<br><br>

	<blockquote><p>Simply put, affiliate marketing involves referring a product or service by sharing it on a blog, social media platforms, or website. The affiliate earns a commission each time someone makes a purchase through the unique link associated with their recommendation. Done well, this performance-based opportunity can go from side hustle to profitable business by netting you a healthy income.</blockquote></p>

	<blockquote><p>Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another. </blockquote></p>

	<h3>What Is Affiliate Marketing, Really?</h3>
	<blockquote><p>Affiliate marketing is the process of earning a commission by promoting another company's product (or service). You find a product, promote it to others, and earn a piece of the profit for each sale that you make.

	In other words, when you help another company generate sales, you get a cut!

	The best part is that you don’t have to spend the time and money to create your own products, because someone else has already done the hard work. You can begin making money as an affiliate as soon as you have a place to recommend products, whether that's a website you have, a podcast, or even on social media.

	So, all you have to do is send traffic through a link to that product, and everything after that is out of your hands . . . right?</p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p>Wrong. There's so much more involved to make this work well, which is why most people who attempt affiliate marketing fail, or just see a few dollars coming in from their efforts. I want you to see amazing, life-changing results from affiliate marketing, which is why I'm thankful you're here.</p></blockquote>

	<h3>This Stuff Works. Here's What It Can Do For You.</h3>
	<blockquote><p>Affiliate marketing is something I’ve been involved in ever since 2009 on my very first website, GreenExamAcademy.com. On that site, an architecture-related website, I promoted an exam software product that has generated more than $200,000 in commissions over the years.

	Since then, I’ve branched out and diversified my affiliate income sources. But much more than that—I’ve made affiliate marketing a cornerstone of my business strategy and my biggest single source of revenue. Since 2009, I've generated over $3 million in commissions with affiliate marketing.

	In fact, my largest affiliate partnership, with a company called ConvertKit, has driven more than $400,000 in revenue alone.</p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p>What's even cooler than the commissions is that as a result of my recommendations, I'm getting thanked by my audience, too.

	Getting paid and getting thanked at the same time? Yes! That's the best kind of marketing, and one every single person should be involved with.

	In this 8-part series, I'll teach you how to get started and find the right products for your audience, even if you're just starting out.

	Instead of worrying about upsetting and annoying your audience with your promotions, I'll show you how to gracefully promote products in a way that people will thank you for the time and effort you put in to help them make a buying decision.

	I'll also teach you about the amazing opportunities you can have related to the companies you help promote for, and the special kinds of deals and offers you can get for yourself, and your audience, through those relationships.

	We have a lot to cover, but I also want to be real with you, too…

	I know you're probably excited, and my history with affiliate marketing all sounds great, but it hasn’t been smooth sailing the whole time.

	In the beginning, I didn't always get it right. I chose the wrong products to promote, and put money over serving my audience at times, and every single time I’ve put money before serving my audience, I’ve failed. I don't want you to fail. I want you to thrive!

	Affiliate marketing has had a bad rap over the years because many affiliate marketers fell into the same traps I did.

	That’s why I’ve made it a big part of my mission to change the perception of affiliate marketing, and to show you how you CAN do it right, and make good money, too.</p></blockquote>
