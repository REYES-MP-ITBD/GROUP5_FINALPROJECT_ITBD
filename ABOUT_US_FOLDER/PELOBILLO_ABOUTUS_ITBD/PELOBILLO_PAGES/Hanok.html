		<h2>Discussion:</h2> 
		<p>
		Hanok villages, which can be found in a few places in Seoul and around Korea, are living museums.
		They're restored and preserved ancient neighborhoods, some in their original location (like Bukchon)
		and some re-created with hanoks (traditional Korean homes) moved from elsewhere. They give visitors an 
		opportunity to not only experience what it was like to live in a hanok, but also what it was like to live in Korea 600 years ago.
		<br>
		You can experience the tiny, narrow streets and also explore Korean culture, as many of the hanoks are museums 
		or offer cultural demonstrations. Some are private homes, and some offer accommodations.
		<br>
		Bukchon Hanok Village is a popular place to explore, as it's right in central Seoul, in the area between the 
		Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Changdeokgung Palace.

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>How to get there:</h2>
		You can get to the Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul by taking the subway to the Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3). Take exit 3 and head 
		to your right. After about 200 meters you will see large information signs that begin the Bukchon Village Walking Tour.
