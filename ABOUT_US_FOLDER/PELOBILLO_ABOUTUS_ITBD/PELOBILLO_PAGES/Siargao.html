		<h2>Discussion:</h2> 
		<p>
		Siargao’s rise as a top tourist spot in the Philippines is nothing short of meteoric.
		Once a sleepy island in Surigao del Norte, it has become one of the favorite destinations 
		and playgrounds for travelers, and it is primarily because of one activity: surfing.

It is now known as the Philippines' surfing capital, and some even regard it as the surfing mecca of Asia.

Surfers are drawn to Cloud 9, the most famous surfing spot in the entire country. From November until
 April, all is well with Cloud 9’s thick tubes, making it a perfect place to get stoked (note: it is recommended for advanced surfers only).

But you do not need to be riding the waves to enjoy this island destination as there are also other fun 
Siargao activities and beautiful attractions to visit like rock pools, waterfalls, and the nearby Sohoton Lagoon, 
where you can swim with thousands of non-sting jellyfish.

		<br>
		<h2>How to get there:</h2>
			
The only direct way to travel from Manila to Siargao is by flight. This flight journey takes 1.5 to 2.5
 hours and tickets start from 3,200 PHP ($64). Another option is to take a series of ferries, with a combined travel
 time of 33.5 hours, excluding transfers.

		<h2>Other places to visit in that city/country:</h2>
			
		Sugba Lagoon<br>
		Sohoton Cove National Park<br>
		Magpupungko Rock Pools<br>
		Guyam Island<br><br>
