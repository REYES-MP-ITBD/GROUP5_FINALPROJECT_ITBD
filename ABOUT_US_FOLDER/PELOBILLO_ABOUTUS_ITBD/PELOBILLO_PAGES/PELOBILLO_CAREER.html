							It all actually started when I was in grade 8. <sup>1</sup>
							My dad and I were playing badminton on the badminton court.	<sup>2</sup>
							I was having fun hitting the shuttlecock repeatedly, <sup>3</sup> then someone saw me playing.<sup>4</sup>
							He asked my dad this <q><i>sir is your son doing badminton training?</i></q> <sup>5</sup>
							then my dad replied <q><i>no, he just like to hit the ball and play always with me</i></q> <sup>6</sup>
							The person who asked my dad was actually shocked when my dad said that,<sup>7</sup> then the person told my dad this
							<q><i>sir you should try to let your son do some badminton training he got some potential</i></q> <sup>8</sup>
							so my dad think about it and then months later my dad and I go back to the court and ask if there is a badminton training there,
							<sup>9</sup> then we saw the guy who told me to try some training and he’s actually my coach.<sup>10</sup>

							That was the day when I started playing badminton seriously,<sup>11</sup>
							I’ve trained hard and my coach really pushed me to do it,<sup>12</sup>
							he wanted me to get stronger in a short time.<sup>13</sup>
							After months of training,<sup>14</sup> my coach told me to join one of the badminton tournaments,<sup>15</sup>
							it was held at Batangas and it’s my first time competing in such an event.<sup>16</sup>
							I was so nervous and but I pulled it off,<sup>17</sup> even though I did not win my first tournament. <sup>18</sup>
							It was a great experience to see other players playing badminton with such a skill.<sup>19</sup>
							So that’s how it all started.<sup>20</sup>
