						So far I’ve experienced a lot of things like playing badminton in every other place,<sup>1</sup>
						I’ve managed to handle a club since I was a club president before, <sup>2</sup>
						I’ve travelled outside the country.<sup>3</sup>
						But with all those experiences I know in myself that there are a lot of things I’m still going to face,<sup>4</sup>
						I’m still a student, <sup>5</sup>
						I may experience a lot but I’m still lacking,<sup>6</sup>
						I actually have this thought like what am I going to do after I graduate, <sup>7</sup>
						I keep asking myself <q>what do I want to do?</q><sup>8</sup> but as of now I’m still preparing,<sup>9</sup>
						I’m still learning.<sup>10</sup> I’ve encountered a lot of problems and challenges I made it.<sup>11</sup>

						My life experience as of now was like a rollercoaster but the highlights that I won’t forget is,<sup>12</sup>
						me having a chance to play outside the country.<sup>13</sup>
						So that's basically the story of my life,<sup>14</sup>
						I love what I'm doing and I'm still in progress<sup>15</sup>
						looking for the right time and the right place.<sup>16</sup>
						I'm Lance Diether M. Pelobillo.<sup>17</sup>
						I hope somehow I inspired you and boost your confidence. <sup>18</sup>
						My life quote is <q>You'll never know how to win, if you don't know how to lose.</q><sup>19</sup>
						The person who said that quote is one of the person I idolize, his name is <q>Lee Chong Wei.</q><sup>20</sup>
