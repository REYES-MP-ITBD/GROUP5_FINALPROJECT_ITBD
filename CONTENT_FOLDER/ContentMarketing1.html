		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It's just as important how you post, promote, and amplify your content as it is what you make. 
		Although your marketing assets help determine who you are as a brand and what message you want to send, 
		the platforms by which you distribute those assets have an impact on who sees it and how well it works.

		own mind share and remain visible in the midst of so many competing distractions.

		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		A term "content syndication" refers to a network of websites that republish or re-feature existing content on the internet, 
		either in its entirety or in brief summaries. Syndication helps the content to reach a wider audience and be used by more people 
		online than it might otherwise.However, most syndication sites are paid services, and the consistency of newfound traffic to your con isn't guaranteed.

		<ol style="margin-left:16em" start="3" type="1" class="content">
		<li style="font-size:30px;"> Event-based marketing </li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Trade shows, seminars, forums, and other group activities are critical to marketing success for businesses that still do a lot of business offline. 
		Event-based marketing blurs the boundaries between physical and digital marketing by combining the two.
		This may include public appearances, webinars, lunch-and-learns, or pop-up booths set up in high-traffic areas. 
		You'll need marketing materials for these activities, such as panorama visuals behind you or written infographics on hand, 
		as well as a promotions plan to get your message heard over the noise.</p>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<ol style="margin-left:16em" start="4" type="1" class="content">
		<li style="font-size:30px;"> Mobile marketing </li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Despite the fact that mobile marketing is really a device choice that cuts through all of the above platforms,
		customer behavior patterns suggest that businesses should consider smartphones and tablets as distinct assets in and of themselves.
		First and foremost, marketing your content on mobile necessitates a truly mobile-responsive web design. 
		It also means refining future content choices to account for less text, more graphics, 
		and a variety of clickable buttons, all of which are easily incorporated into the web sites, emails, and social feeds.
		Mobile traffic also includes the thousands of apps available to customers, including podcasts, news aggregators, 
		and even standalone branded apps all micro channels through which you can promote your company.

		</ol>
		<br>
		<ol style="margin-left:16em" start="5" type="1" class="content">
		<li style="font-size:30px;"> Podcasting </li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Podcasting allows the company to delve deeper into niche topics, interview industry experts, and network with like-minded businesses and customers. 
		It's a perfect way to get the message out loud so people will listen to it while driving, riding the bus, working out, cooking dinner, 
		or anytime they have free time.</p>

		<ol style="margin-left:16em" start="6" type="1" class="content">
		<li style="font-size:30px;">  Link building </li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Since Google ranking considers quality, reputable backlinks from authoritative sites when determining rankings, 
		acquiring those links is a very effective way to expand your brand's scope. The trick to link building is to publish your
		content and then get it into the right hands. Each incoming domain URL's connection juice will improve your site's rankings.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Social media will help you add personality, cause, and commentary to your marketing. You can post targeted content on one 
		channel and other forms of assets on another, so you can reach your audience wherever they are.You can also use your social media accounts
		to respond to subscribers and followers, monitor interaction in real time, promote products, and network with influencers.
		It's a flexible, thriving environment to take advantage of.</p>

		<li style="font-size:30px;"> Email marketing </li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Email marketing has the highest return on investment of any medium. You can cut through the noise of the
		internet and have one-on-one conversations with prospects and consumers by sending emails, gated properties,
		and other types of branded content directly to the inboxes of your email list.You can deliver content with precision by 
		segmenting your email lists into different account categories, reader purpose, and industries. 
		This ensures that your message reaches the right people at the right time.</p>

		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Organic content that drives search engine traffic is a fantastic long-term investment. However, 
		there are times when your organization requires a quicker, more observable type of ROI,
		which can be achieved by paid search advertising. Paid search ads, which are a type of pay-per-click advertisement, 
		appear at the top (and often the bottom) of SERPs, giving your brand big exposure that it wouldn't get otherwise. 
		Using landing pages, branded ad copy, and clickable titles in your paid advertising, 
		you can steal traffic from rivals and funnel commercial leads to your web.</p>

		<li style="font-size:30px;"> Organic traffic (SEO) </li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Search engine optimization (SEO) is used to generate organic traffic. 
		In effect, site visitors click on your content that they find in organic SERPs
		all because of a search query.Search engines index and serve the content you post on your web, and it doesn't have to be just blog posts. 
		Video content and infographics actually, something unrestricted and even show up in SERPs, giving you more visibility and the 
		opportunity to drive traffic to your site.</p>
